## [0.44.6]
- Breaking: Codex setup now uses a single default-provider flow and removes the older multi-profile conflict/update screens.
- Codex setup now detects all MeshAgent-managed Codex configs instead of only the active project or API host, so stale configs can be updated or removed during setup.

## [0.44.5]
- OpenAI completions now emit structured assistant text and tool-call lifecycle events, including arguments and results, so consumers can reconstruct streamed assistant and tool activity.
- Reasoning-end events are now preserved even when no active reasoning buffer exists, as long as metadata is available, which restores reasoning dataset replay.
- OpenAI response handling now includes all structured output items instead of only message and compaction items, improving replay coverage for additional response types.

## [0.44.4]
- Breaking: `AgentSessionContext` no longer exposes `previous_messages` or `previous_response_id`; restore flows now operate from the current `messages` payload instead of maintaining a separate history buffer.
- OpenAI Responses restore now preserves encrypted reasoning metadata, normalizes legacy reasoning items, and forces stateless requests to use `store=False` while replaying the current context.
- Agent event handling and dataset thread storage now keep reasoning provider/model metadata so empty reasoning items with encrypted content can still be restored without losing the payload.
- Managed agents now share the `llm` backend abstraction, which changes thread creation and resume behavior and lets thread naming consider the selected provider/model plus audio attachments.
- Updated `typer` to `~=0.26.6`.

## [0.44.3]
- Stability

## [0.44.2]
- Base chat clients now expose an async event stream for consuming emitted agent payloads alongside listener callbacks.

- Thread startup now preserves better thread naming and metadata, including fallback names derived from message content and attachments when no explicit name is provided.
- Managed-agent server code now creates thread metadata earlier and persists thread naming information consistently through websocket-driven lifecycles.
- Single-room and Codex orchestration now avoid unnecessary toolkit-discovery waits and improve startup latency and initialization behavior.

## [0.43.4]
- Public room toolkit metadata now preserves annotations end-to-end, and the SDK exports tool-search metadata for consumers that need to discover searchable tools.
- Tool listings now round-trip annotations alongside tools and participant IDs, so extra toolkit metadata is no longer lost when clients read or write it.
- Agent and room message handling now keeps `created_at` timestamps through streamed deltas and live thread updates, improving ordering and replay consistency.
- Responses integration now supports tool namespaces and search across the Python agent tooling stack.

## [0.43.3]

- Removed the hard dependency on the Codex binary wheel.

## [0.43.0]
- `meshagent-agents` now supports backend-aware multi-backend supervision, with backend metadata in thread/model messages, attachment-aware prompts, and backend-aware thread/model/realtime-audio operations.

- `meshagent-openai` now preserves image-generation call inputs and emits structured image-generation results, and the LLM proxy and agent server websocket auth path now accept the `meshagent-agent.` token prefix.
- Third-party dependency updates include `textual-image[textual]~=0.12.0` for inline image rendering.

## [0.42.2]
- Added `wait_for_exit_status` and richer container/build models, exposing image IDs, runtime stats, published build image digests, and detailed exit status information while keeping the existing integer exit-code helper.
- The deploy flow now resolves completed builds to published digests, rewrites deploy plans to use the resolved image reference, and cleans up replaced built images after successful deploys.
- Room client shutdown is now cancellation-safe, so protocol teardown completes even if exit is cancelled mid-close.
- CLI API URL resolution now prefers `MESHAGENT_API_URL` before the persisted active URL, matching the explicit environment override users expect.

## [0.42.1]
- Deploy liveness checks now treat `401` and `403` responses as live, improving detection for protected endpoints.

- Deploy TUI now supports copying selected text or the full deploy log buffer to the clipboard.

## [0.42.0]
- Added project lookup by key.
- Service and route specs now support container templates, `host_port`, and `stripPrefix`; route-path serialization omits `stripPrefix` when it is false.

- Room creation and room-service helpers now carry annotations and permissions through the API.
- Container creation and room-client helpers now accept the `template` option.

- `meshagent` now performs a best-effort startup version check, warns when the installed client is older than the server, and `meshagent version` reports both client and server versions instead of the previous raw version string, so scripts that parse the old output need to update.

## [0.41.8]
- Stability

## [0.41.7]
- Deployment config models now carry optional server version metadata, allowing API consumers to read the server version from config responses.
- CLI config lookup now supports returning the deployment version, and the version command now prints both client and server versions.

- `ChatThreadSession` now exposes thread-start, turn-steer, and interrupt workflows, along with richer pending-input state and active-turn tracking for acceptance, application, and rejection events.
- Container and service models now support a `template` value (`agent` or `none`), and container runs can opt into that template to receive the standard agent runtime environment and mount defaults.

## [0.41.3]
- Stability

## [0.41.2]
- `meshagent create` now uses clearer stable focus IDs and labels, adds an Anthropic chatbot option, and prints grouped next steps plus agent-toolkit deploy guidance for backend-agent templates.
- `meshagent rooms list` now defaults to rooms the current user can access, with `--all` to switch back to listing every room in the project.
- Deploy-room prompting now derives the Pages suffix from the configured API host, pre-fills a room-based subdomain, and validates subdomain-only input before constructing the final public domain.
- The CLI chat and process runtime now centralize turn-toolkit assembly and thread-list tooling through the supervisor, while websocket chat sessions keep web participants aligned with the base participant identity for on-behalf-of access.

## [0.41.1]
- Python feed subscription APIs and CLI commands now support an optional `filename_datetime_format`, and listing shows the stored value.
- The create workflow now prints a `cd` hint for new subfolders and blocks reusing an already occupied nested folder.
- Image deploys now preserve Dockerfile default environment values and clear the newly built image from the room cache after a successful build.

## [0.41.0]
- Managed-agent support now includes thread listing, thread create/update/delete events, attachment names, and sender-name trust for chat input.

- Changed default behavior for `content_format="html"` to strip `scripts` and inline image data URLs while preserving the rest of the HTML (and updated `--clean` CLI usage to map onto the new stripping configuration)
- Broke Scrapy dataset output schema by removing `links`, `link_urls`, `image_urls`, and reducing `images` to `src`/`alt` only; inline image data URLs are excluded from extracted images
